## Update log
### 07/02/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Fixed the problem that the car plot node asks for allocation and maneuver again. Now only control node is doing these;
2. **[large-map branch]** Moved the path parameter to the yaml file, so that the tuning is easier. Also the `is_random` option is moved there as well.
3. **[large-map branch]** Record the total time of each vehicle, total time of entire task as well. When dead lock can not be solved, pass this iteration and record "-1" to these data files.

### 06/30/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Fixed the data saving function so that the weird dead lock can be investigated
2. **[large-map branch]** Added random_all strategy which select randomly in all free spots.

### 06/29/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Added Solo strategy, which assigns space from end to front with interval, then starts from end again.
2. **[large-map branch]** Changed the `add_time` and `add_wait_time` so that it accumulates dt directly.
3. **[large-map branch]** The arrival time interval is exponentially distributed. 
4. Add the iteration layer that can directly loop over all interval sizes

### 06/26/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Random strategy is desined and the corresponding data recording is available.

### 06/20/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** "Same Side" allocation strategies are written as parameterized by interval size;
2. **[large-map branch]** Costmap is extended to make sure there is no collision before the entrance.

### 06/06/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** The collision detection must detect ALL vehicles rather than ones with higher priorities. The previous detection logic is commented.
2. **[large-map branch]** Allocation strategies are written in a seperate file and different plans are started to be designed.
3. **[large-map branch]** Decentralied the control. All car act at the same time based on the analysis of situation in last time step.
4. **[large-map branch]** Added the dead lock detection and resolution method. Detection: if all vehicles are waiting, there is a dead lock. Solution: change the maneuver of the vehicle which is at the highest priority and is currently parking (this should be a participant of dead lock).
5. **[large-map branch]** Fixed the bug in the simluator. Before the fix, previous plotters will not be cleared and they will be very messy after a few iterations. 

### 06/03/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Improved the collision detection while turning. Now the detection pattern is the same as the case in straight lane. 
2. **[large-map branch]** The time counter should be working properly and available for study.
3. **[large-map branch]** Finished the repeatation test and record the waiting time into CSV file. 
4. **[large-map branch]** Add the arg to roslaunch file so that the visualization is optional, which can speed up the test.
5. To-do: Examine the decentralized method and possible dead lock. Think about the way to rewrite the spot allocation.

### 06/03/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Added the collision detetcion while turning.
2. To-do: Keep cleaning the code and test a best circular motion.

### 06/02/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Added circular motion to turning part, but the collision avoidance method is not modified.
2. **[large-map branch]** Combined the spot allocation funtion into the initialization function of Vehicle Class.
3. To-do: Clean the code, test a best circular motion, and fix the collision detection while turning.

### 05/14/2019
1. **[large-map branch]** Fixed some bugs in allocation and now 44 cars can park. The hold simulation need about 30mins on the Thinkpad Desktop.

### 05/13/2019
1. Instead of parallelly making collision free decision, now the vehicles have their priorities. The first car in the queue has the highest priority. The collision check only exists when considering other higher-priority counterparts.
2. **[large-map branch]** Constructed a larger map and rewrote the dynamics and maneuver offsets.
3. **[large-map branch]** The larger map works and the corresponding maneuvers are also shifted.

### 05/12/2019
Back to ROS
1. Changed the initialization as randomized. The starting time, the lane and end pose are all chosen randomly. The end spot is chosen from the farest end to nearest.
2. The random parameters can be saved and reloaded to recover the last experiment.

### 04/25/2019
1. In MATLAB, implemented the algorithm in reference[2] about intersection conflict resolution. 
2. Three cars use double integrator model on pre-planned path. The safety constraints are formulated as QCQP and then relaxed as SDP. For rank-1 constraint, randomization technique is adopted.
3. This technique in intersection scenario can be adopted to parking lot.

### 04/02/2019
1. Fixed the bug in cost writting function when writing the parking trajectory to cost map. Now all the grids that the car body covers will be registered in the cost map. The collision is therefore totally avoided.
2. The cost map is now a 2-tuple (cost, car_num) which marks the cost and the producer of it at the same time. Cars will not identify the cost produced by itself as collision.
3. Modified the class of some functions.
4. **Now, the naive Centralized Critical-region Regulation approach is finished. Some drawbacks of this method include: 1) The input is instantly changable constant velocity / zero, which is unrealistic and uncomfortable driving; 2) The efficiency is bad. The next car will need to wait until all process of the previous car is finished. 3) The completeness is not gauranteed if there is some strange incoming order or target perference.**


### 03/31/2019
1. Set up roslaunch and parameter service. Now H-OBCA, plot and control can be started by a single roslaunch.
2. Edited the cost map update: In the loop of every car, the map is firstly reset, then loop around every other car to collect the location and maenuver data
3. Edited the collision detection: If the car is going straight, check the cost in front of the path; if the car is in the middle of the parking maneuver, check the collision in the rest of the path.
4. The algorithm works when there is only 5 cars. When added the number of cars to 12, a dead lock happens between cars. Therefore, **the time information should be considered in the collision avoidance, or the cost map should include producer name of the corresponding cost**.

### 03/30/2019
1. H-OBCA can now save and load from file
2. The cost map can now be visualized
3. Fixed some bug about multiple cars. Abd added a lot functions for multiple cars. Now the simulation can be carried out for multiple cars.
4. The problem still exist: 1) The maneuver need to be specified from the begininng; 2) The collision avoidance is not always reliable 

### 03/26/2019
1. Added the "Go straight" function and the maneuver client, now single car can go along straight lane and park according to the specificed slot
2. Added the cost map class, and define a naive cost map for the second car to identify the obstacle
3. Added the second car to show up after some delay and avoid the first car by looking up the cost map
4. There are a lot of bugs when two car is acting, need to fix next time. The current version is just a hard-coded demo (The plot function is also ugly changed to make a temperary 2-car demo)

### 03/25/2019
1. Built the plotting node which can subscribe to the car state and input topic and plot the car box and trajectory
2. Small adjustion to the slot width parameters

### 03/09/2019
1. Set up the ROS Package file structure, msg and srv
2. Package `parking` is the main package for the future design of parking algorithm. The msg, srv are written here.
3. A service is designed to let package `parking` get the desired parking maneuver from H-OBCA. The testing client node is successfully implemented.
4. Reorganized the H-OBCA code structure and make `main.jl` as a function. Fixed some bugs in the code.
5. `run_HOBCA` is finished to iterate all possible parameters and generate the maneuver dictionary. 
6. Made the H-OBCA as a ros package and define a server node to provide parking module with requested maneuver.

### 03/04/2019
Reorganized the files and archived MATLAB code into a seperate folder
